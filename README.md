Please note: this is the fork of the original `rank-amateur-cowsay`

I forked this repo to have a place for publishing the cow file
initially originating from the [unsubsquirrel sticker initiative](https://store.ecompanystore.com/redhat/Shop/#/product/Search/RHT170013.000000-Red-Hat-remotee-sticker),
which was started by Rebecca Fernandez from Red Hat.

Following is the rest of the original README.

# rank-amateur-cowsay

This is cowsay, imported directly from my ancient CVS repository,
plus a few documentation tweaks to make it a bit more friendly to
GitHub.  Functionality remains unchanged from all pre-GitHub commits.

Cowsay was a project for learning how to use Perl 5, as well as
general amusement.  If the code looks like it was written by an
inexperienced programmer, that's because it was.

If you are interested in the future of cowsay beyond what is here,
then I encourage you to read CONTRIBUTING.md in this directory.

I am no longer interested in maintaining cowsay; there are other
demands on my time that take precedence.

Enthusiasm for cowsay has gone far beyond what I expected, and if
cowsay is to have a future, then the least I can do is not stand
in the way of it.

Enjoy cowsay for what it was meant to be: simple and silly.
